# Apply changes

The feature helps you integrate AI-suggested changes to your codebase with a single click. Copy the full response (or just a single file block) to your clipboard, then return to VS Code and click the "Apply changes" button in the status bar (or use the corresponding command).

_Structure of the generated message:_

```
<file>...</file> (original file)
User requested refactor of a file. In your response send fully updated <file> only, without explanations or any other text.
[CODE BLOCK CONTENT]
```

Full responses targeting multiple files to be parsed correctly, code blocks must contain filenames in expected places. When initializing AI Studio through the Connector web browser extension we ask it to use "name" attribute in system instructions. The same format is supported by default in Github Copilot. The other format "first line comment" is commonly used by other supported chatbots not supporting system instructions like DeepSeek.

## How it Works

You copied...

<Tabs groupId="apply-changes-2">
  <TabItem value="format" label='whole response'>

     - Text surrounding code blocks are discarded.
     - Each code block containing file name is extracted.
     - You'll be prompted to choose between **Intelligent update** and **Fast replace**
       - **Intelligent update**: For each file block found, the extension sends separate messages to the default model set for applying changes with the original file and the provided block content (treated as instructions/diff) to generate the fully updated file. If a file doesn't exist, it will be created.
       - **Fast replace**: For each file block found, the content is used to either overwrite an existing file or create a new one. This mode is instantaneous but assumes the clipboard contains the complete, final content for each file.
     - In both modes, you get an option to **Revert** the changes immediately after they are applied.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="comment" label="single code block">
   - Uses the content from your active file in VS Code.
   - The code block from the clipboard is treated as instructions for changes.
   - The extension sends a message to the AI model with your file content and the clipboard instructions.
   - Your active file is replaced with the AI-generated update.
   - You get an option to **Revert** the changes immediately after they are applied.

  </TabItem>
